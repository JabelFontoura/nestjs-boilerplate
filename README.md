# NestJS Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate for setting up new applications using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework. It provides a robust starting point for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

## Features

- **PostgreSQL Integration**: This boilerplate comes with PostgreSQL configured out of the box. The `docker-compose.yml` file includes a service for running a PostgreSQL database.

- **Unit Tests**: The project is set up with a `test` directory for end-to-end testing.

- **Pre-configured Modules**: The `src/modules` directory contains pre-configured modules to kickstart your development.
